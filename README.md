### 📃 History

---

Some time ago, this repository used to carry my first ReactJS project. 🥲

<<<<<<< HEAD
Even though it is kinda of overkill to create a personal website (portolio-like) with React, I decided to stick around and redesign it. ⚛️
=======
Used `AOS` for on scroll animations. I'm surprised how easy it is to use this library.

It's design was inspired by [this creation](https://dribbble.com/shots/15187218-Adam-Zonski-Personal-Portfolio-Website) and transposed/remade in this [figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/cibaFLJNSHOa8dKKn3V9Mo/antoniopataro?node-id=69%3A42).

You can find this and some older desings for my personal website in this [figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/cibaFLJNSHOa8dKKn3V9Mo/Personal-Website?node-id=272%3A31).

### ⚙️ Technologies

---

- `ReactJS`, which includes `HTML`, `CSS` and `Javascript`;
- `styled-components`, a pretty nice CSS in JS library;
- `AOS` (Animate on Sroll), a simple lib for animations on scroll!
