A simple project for a personal website meant for me!
Its intent was actually to test out my junior Front-End skills. It may be a real website someday. 🔥

### 📃 History

---

This is my first step into JavaScript frameworks and libraries. It's made with React.
In the proccess, I also discovered `styled-components` and liked it a lot. It really makes dinamically styles something easy.

Used `AOS` for on scroll animations. I'm surprised how easy it is to use this library.

It's design was inspired by [this creation](https://dribbble.com/shots/15187218-Adam-Zonski-Personal-Portfolio-Website) and transposed/remade in this [figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/cibaFLJNSHOa8dKKn3V9Mo/antoniopataro?node-id=69%3A42).

It's also my first React project. ⚛️

### ⚙️ Technologies

---

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript (React as Framework/Lib)
- Figma (for Design)

Note: Contact info is currently retained on `sessionStorage`.
Note 2: Despite it works, the stylization is a mess right now. I could, but I don't think I'm going to refactor it in a near future, because I'm into other projects at the moment.
