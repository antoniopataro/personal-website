### 📃 History

---

This is my first step into JavaScript frameworks and libraries. It's made with React.
In the proccess, I also discovered `styled-components` and liked it a lot. It really makes dinamically styles something easy.

It's design was inspired by [this creation](https://dribbble.com/shots/15187218-Adam-Zonski-Personal-Portfolio-Website) and transposed/remade in this [figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/cibaFLJNSHOa8dKKn3V9Mo/antoniopataro?node-id=69%3A42).

It's also my first React project. ⚛️
