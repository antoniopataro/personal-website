          time there, I had my first contact with programming.

          In {FIRST_YEAR_OF_EXPERIENCE}, I already couldn&apos;t help but learn
          as much as I could, as fast as I could, taking a leap of faith to drop
          out of college and pursue this career as a self-taught. Since then, I
          made my way into this industry, specializing in web development.

          As a beginner, I enjoyed front-end. Later on, back-end became my
          passion. Now, full-stack development is my specialty â€• mainly with
          Node.js and Go.
